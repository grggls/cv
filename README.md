*I require a visa/sponsorship to work outside the US*

Senior Systems Engineer with experience leading teams, planning and executing agile projects, coding infrastructures, maintaining performance, security, fault-tolerance and overall system health. Desired roles include senior-level site reliability engineer, devops engineer, operations engineer, AWS architect, and infrastructure engineer. I’m also interested in interviewing for engineering manager roles.

Working with developers, product, management, and customers, I’ve spent almost twenty years building and maintaining stable systems in mission-critical, high-traffic environments. Believing the whole engineering staff should be empowered and responsible for system health, customer experience, and the speed with which experiments are conducted and features delivered is at the heart of not only my work but the way it's communicated and shared.

Research interests include Data, Crypto, Sustainability, Agtech, IoT, Renewable Energy, Sharing Economies
